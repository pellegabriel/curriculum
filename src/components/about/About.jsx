            Hello my Name Is Gabriel. I come from the land called Argentina,
            more specifically from Santa Cruz / RÃ­o Gallegos. I have the
            qualities of a dedicated subject interested in web development and
            who in turn loves art.
            <br />
            I would like to create pages mixing several disciplines, which I am
            perfecting day by day.
            <br />
            I am more than willing to learn and create new projects, if
            you are interested and I can be of use to you in some work/task,
            contact me in the contact section, and I will gladly answer you.
          </p>
          <a href="#contact" className="nes-btn is-primary">
